    <h1>Croissant 🥐</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A croissant is a French pastry, traditionally crescent-shaped and made from a laminated yeast dough, resulting in a buttery, flaky, and airy texture.</p>
    <p>A good croissant should be golden brown, crispy, and flaky on the outside, with a soft and airy interior. </p>
    <p>Croissants are commonly enjoyed for breakfast or as a snack, often paired with coffee or tea. </p>
